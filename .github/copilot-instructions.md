# Copilot Instructions for Python Development

This project uses a modern, high-performance Python toolchain. Please adhere to the following guidelines and tool usages when generating code or commands.

## instructions

- **Location**: The files located in the `.github/` directory provide specific instructions for various aspects of development. Always check for relevant instruction files before generating code or commands.
- please refer to .github/super_powers.md for extensive skills and protocols related to the Superpowers system, which may be relevant for certain tasks.

## Toolchain & Workflow

### Dependency & Project Management: `uv`

- **Primary Tool**: Use `uv` for all project management tasks.
- **Overview**: `uv` is an extremely fast Python package and project manager written in Rust. It effectively replaces `pip`, `poetry`, and `pip-tools`.
- **Commands**:
  - Add dependencies: `uv add <package>`
  - Add dev dependencies: `uv add --dev <package>`
  - Run scripts: `uv run <script.py>` or `uv run -m <module>`
  - Sync environment: `uv sync` (creates/updates `.venv`)
  - Lock dependencies: `uv lock`
- **Configuration**: Managed in `pyproject.toml`.

### Linting & Formatting: `ruff`

- **Linter & Formatter**: Use `ruff` for all linting and formatting.
- **Overview**: `ruff` is an extremely fast Python linter and code formatter written in Rust. It replaces tools like Black, Flake8, and isort.
- **Commands**:
  - Check: `uvx ruff check` (fix with `--fix`)
  - Format: `uvx ruff format`
- **Style**: Code should be compliant with `ruff`'s default rules and any overrides in `pyproject.toml` or `ruff.toml`.

### Type Checking: `ty`

- **Type Checker**: Use `ty` for static type checking.
- **Overview**: `ty` is a fast Python type checker and language server found in the Astral ecosystem.
- **Commands**:
  - Check: `uvx ty check`
- **Typing**: Ensure all code is fully typed. Use modern Python type hinting features.

### Task Management: `just`

- **Task Runner**: Uses `just` to run project-specific tasks.
- **Overview**: `just` is a handy command runner that saves and runs project-specific commands (recipes) stored in a `Justfile`.
- **Usage**: Check the `Justfile` (if present) for available recipes.
- **Recommendation**: If users ask to run common tasks (build, test, lint), check if a `just` recipe exists.
- **installation**: `just` can be installed via package managers like `brew`, `apt`, or using uv:
  ```bash
  uv tool install rust-just
  ```

### Git Hooks: `pre-commit`

- **Automation**: `pre-commit` ensures code quality before committing.
- **Overview**: Framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks.
- **Commands**:
  - Run manually: `uvx pre-commit run --all-files`
- **installation**:
  ```bash
  uv tool install pre-commit
  pre-commit install
  ```

### Build System: `hatchling`

- **Backend**: The project uses `hatchling` as the build backend.
- **Overview**: `hatchling` is a modern, extensible build backend for Python projects.
- **Configuration**: Build settings are defined in the `[build-system]` section of `pyproject.toml`.

### Testing: `pytest`

- **Framework**: Use `pytest` for testing.
- **Overview**: The pytest framework makes it easy to write small, readable tests, and can scale to support complex functional testing.
- **Commands**:
  - Run tests: `uv run pytest`
- **Practices**: Write unit tests for new functionality in the `tests/` directory.

## Commit Messages

- **Strict Requirement**: You **MUST** reference and follow the commit message conventions defined in `.copilot-commit-message-instructions.md` located in the project root.
- All generated commit messages should adhere to the format and rules specified in that file.

## General Development Guidelines

- **Modern Python**: Use modern Python features (3.10+).
- **Type Safety**: Prioritize type safety and clarity.
- **Performance**: Leverage the speed of the provided Rust-based tools (`uv`, `ruff`, `ty`).

## MCP & Agent Selection

- **Context7**: Use for querying library and tool usage if MCP and sub-agents are available.
- **Planning**: Use Gemini series models (3+).
- **Implementation**: Use Claude (4.5+) or Grok Code, with priority given to Claude.
- **Review**: Use GPT.
